# CS294_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning

## CS294 Deep Reinforcement Learning @ University of California, Berkeley
This repository contains implementations of various deep reinforcement learning algorithms for Mujoco environments, they are my assignments for this course, [UC Berkeley's CS294 Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).

*Disclaimer: The code contained in this repository are my own implementations. I would only post my solutions 5 days after a certain assignment ddl (we have 5 late days). I would love to discuss after I post. *

Also, the [original course git repo](https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework). 

## Dependencies
* Python **3.5**
* Numpy version **1.14.5**
* TensorFlow version **1.10.5**
* MuJoCo version **1.50** and mujoco-py **1.50.1.56**
* OpenAI Gym version **0.10.5**
