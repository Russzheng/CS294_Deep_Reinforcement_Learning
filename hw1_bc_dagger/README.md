Once Python **3.5** is installed, you can install the remaining dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Look at `run_expert.py`, which is code to load up an expert policy, run a specified number of roll-outs, and save out data.

In `experts/`, the provided expert policies are:
* Ant-v2.pkl
* HalfCheetah-v2.pkl
* Hopper-v2.pkl
* Humanoid-v2.pkl
* Reacher-v2.pkl
* Walker2d-v2.pkl

The name of the pickle file corresponds to the name of the gym environment.
